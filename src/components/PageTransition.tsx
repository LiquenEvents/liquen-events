/**
 * Route transitions.
 *
 * We deliberately DON'T use the browser's View Transitions API for route
 * changes. That API snapshots the whole outgoing AND incoming page into
 * compositor layers, freezing the document while it captures — and on our
 * image-heavy heroes (e.g. /sobre's full-bleed 100svh photo) that capture
 * collides with the new route hydrating and decoding its hero, so the
 * transition visibly stuttered no matter how cheap the animated property was.
 *
 * Instead every navigation runs a single lightweight CSS fade on ONLY the
 * incoming content (`.route-fade` in globals.css): no whole-page snapshot, no
 * frozen document, no dual-layer capture — just one composited opacity animation
 * on the new page. That's the cheapest possible transition and stays 60fps even
 * while the new route is still settling. (To bring the View Transitions path
 * back — directional slides, shared-element morphs — flip USE_VIEW_TRANSITIONS
 * to true; the implementation below and the ::view-transition-* rules in
 * globals.css are kept intact.)
 *
 * Entrances are applied ONLY on client-side navigations — never on the very
 * first paint. Animating the initial page would hold the LCP hero invisible
 * while it fades, hurting Largest Contentful Paint. We capture the entry
 * pathname once: the landing render stays static (matches SSR — no hydration
 * mismatch), every subsequent route animates.
